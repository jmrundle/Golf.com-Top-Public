A Gil Hanse restoration shows the importance that the club places in presenting its course in a first-rate manner, and a distant church steeple completes the idyllic New England setting.

The duo took a flat parcel of desert landscape and built a grassland-fringed layout where the fairways are wide and taking the proper angles is rewarded. This is the antithesis of desert-style target golf. Greens are slightly elevated; miss those and your short game will be tested. Two of the strongest par-4s come early at the 3rd and 4th holes, while the 12th and its fun, split fairway set the tone for the back nine. Best of all is the par-5 2nd with out-of-bounds snug down the left side \u2014\u00a0it makes golfers do strange things! Max fee: $105 (Photo: Courtesy of Talking Stick Golf Club)",
